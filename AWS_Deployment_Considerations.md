# AWS Deployment Considerations

## AWS Services for Deployment

- **Amazon EC2**: For hosting the Node.js application.
- **Amazon RDS**: For database management.
- **Amazon S3**: For storing static assets and backups.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: For content delivery and caching.
- **Amazon SNS**: For sending notifications.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: For monitoring and logging.
- **AWS IAM**: For managing access and permissions.

## High-Level Architecture Overview

The following description outlines the deployment architecture on AWS, showing how the services are interconnected to support the notification system.

## Diagram Description

To create a high-level architecture diagram for deploying the notification system on AWS, you can use a diagramming tool like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or any other preferred tool. Here's a description of the components and their interactions that you can use to create the diagram:

1. **Amazon EC2**: 
   - Host the Node.js application.
   - Connects to Amazon RDS for database operations.

2. **Amazon RDS**: 
   - Manages the database for storing notification data and user information.

3. **Amazon S3**: 
   - Stores static assets and backups.
   - Can be used for storing logs or other large files.

4. **Amazon CloudFront**: 
   - Distributes content globally with low latency.
   - Caches static assets from Amazon S3.

5. **Amazon SNS**: 
   - Sends notifications to users via different channels (email, SMS, etc.).

6. **Amazon CloudWatch**: 
   - Monitors application performance and logs.
   - Sends alerts based on predefined metrics.

7. **AWS IAM**: 
   - Manages access and permissions for AWS resources.

### Diagram Layout

- **Frontend**: 
  - Users interact with the application hosted on EC2.

- **Backend**: 
  - EC2 instances run the Node.js application.
  - Connects to RDS for database operations.
  - Uses SNS for sending notifications.

- **Storage and Content Delivery**: 
  - S3 stores static files.
  - CloudFront caches and delivers content globally.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: 
  - CloudWatch monitors application metrics and logs.

- **Security and Access Management**: 
  - IAM manages user access and permissions.
